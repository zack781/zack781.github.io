  As an Embedded Engineering Intern at Applied Materials in Rochester, NY, from May to August 2024, I enhanced client-side features using React.js, Axios, and Bootstrap to improve the usability of RF Plasma systems in semiconductor manufacturing. I developed high-performance web application tests with Selenium WebDriver and Robot Framework, ensuring system reliability and robustness. Additionally, I built and managed Linux-based web server endpoints using Nginx with FastCGI and Python, enabling seamless WebSocket communication. To optimize product configurations and real-time updates, I implemented JSON and Protobuf over Pub/Sub WebSockets, ensuring efficient data handling.

  As a Software Engineer Intern at Rakuna in Hanoi, Vietnam from June 2023 to December 2023, I contributed to enhancing the company's email campaign product by optimizing the Rails MVC architecture and background job processing, leading to the acquisition of six new customers. I also improved the UX/UI by integrating React Material UI, enabling features such as search auto-completion, keyboard shortcuts, and enhanced mail formatting. Additionally, I streamlined Rakuna’s email CRM system by leveraging SendGrid API, SideKiq, Redis, and ElasticSearch, while ensuring system reliability through RSpec testing.

As a Real-time Multimedia Systems Researcher at NYU Research Technology’s High-Speed Research Network (HSRN) in New York, from 2022 to 2025, I have contributed to advancing networked audio and real-time data management. I developed a C++ JUCE-based audio plugin utilizing WebSockets and UDP to enable seamless audio transport for over 100 attendees at the 2023 TURN UP Multimedia concert. Additionally, I optimized Corelink’s access control system using Knex.js, enhancing its security and real-time data management capabilities. To expand Corelink’s functionality, I integrated plugin support, enabling greater flexibility for diverse real-time applications in research and development. My contributions also extended to securing research funding, where I played a role in grant proposals, successfully obtaining $2,500 in awards from the NYU Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund.
