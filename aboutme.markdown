## Who I Am

A driven and passionate engineer in the making at NYU, pursuing a major in _Computer Engineering_ with a minor in _Applied Physics_. My interest lies in real-time application, cloud computing, and networking. I am aspired to build new technology that can make the world a better place. 


## Why I Chose Compute Engineering

I did not have my own computer until I was in 6th grade. When I did have my own computer, I did not see it right away as a tool to write code, algorithms, and build useful applications. I simply viewed it as a way to play Minecraft, watch Youtube, or do homework. It was not until I had my first ever CS class in 8th grade that I started to understand the amount of effort that needs to be put into making a blazingly fast, highly reliable, and multi-featured computer. I became so inspired by the people who made computers possible and decided that I was gonna spend my future doing the same thing.

## Why I Chose Applied Physics

I have always admired the way in which physical laws and theories come to exist. However, the reason why I decided to do a minor in Applied Physics is not to learn more physics concepts and formulas but to discover how genuine curiosity about nature can lead to profound insights about the universe.

## Fun Facts About Me

In my free time, I enjoy reading Medium articles and watching documentaries.
