I'm currently a student at New York University pursuing a major in _Computer Engineering_ with a minor in _Applied Physics_. My interest lies in real-time application, cloud computing, and networking. I am aspired to build new technology that can make the world a better place.

In my free time, I enjoy reading Medium articles and watching documentaries.
