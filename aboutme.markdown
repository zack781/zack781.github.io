## Who I Am
{: style="margin: 0rem;" :}
A driven and passionate engineer in the making at NYU, pursuing a major in _Computer Engineering_ with a minor in _Applied Physics_. My interest lies in real-time application, cloud computing, and networking. I am aspired to build new technology that can make the world a better place.

## Why I Chose Compute Engineering

I did not have my own computer until I was in 6th grade. When I did have my own computer, I did not see it right away as a tool to write code, algorithms, and build useful applications. I simply viewed it as a way to play Minecraft, watch Youtube, or do homework. It was not until I had my first ever CS class in 8th grade that I started to understand the amount of effort that needs to be put into making a blazingly fast, highly reliable, and multi-featured computer. I became so inspired by the people who made computers possible and decided that I was gonna spend my future doing the same thing.

## Why I Chose Applied Physics

I have always admired the way in which physical laws and theories come to exist. However, the reason why I decided to do a minor in Applied Physics is not to learn more physics concepts and formulas but to discover how genuine curiosity about nature can lead to profound insights about the universe.

## NYU Global Leaders and Scholars in STEM
I am very grateful to be a part of the NYU GLobal Leaders and Scholars in STEM (GLASS) program as it has given me many opportunities that would not have been possible otherwise.

Utilizing the GLASS funding, I have managed to attend the 2nd largest C++ conference in the world (Core C++) and the KubeCon Cloud Native conference. Going to these conferences have exposed me to the current state of the art in the C++ programming languages as well as different cloud technology in the world. I also got to meet very technically comptentent engineers who inspired me to become an even better engineer.

I particularly love the GLASS community where I get to learn from the experience of other cohort's members and share memorable time on team building activites. I believe it is important to be aware of the interdisciplinary nature of engineering as no one field of STEM can exist on its own. GLASS gives me the chance to exercise this aspect through its many guest speaking events and its diversed community with members from all different majors.

I have grown both personally and professionally through GLASS. What I am most proud of from my GLASS experience  are the achievements that I have made in pursuing the NAE Grand challenges and the UN Sustainability goals.

## Fun Facts About Me

In my free time, I enjoy reading Medium articles and watching documentaries.
