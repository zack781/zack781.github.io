The most well known apps in the world today with the largest users are built on very gigantic backend systems that are inherently centralized. Since we have no way of knowing what is under the hood, we can not fully trust corporations to ensure that our data is not manipulated or tampered with in undesirable ways. One recent and popular breach of this trust is Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal where millions of users' personal data were leaked to individuals and organizations with no association to Facebook.

This Dapp aims to impose a transparency standard where the access control policy of the different backend architectures are open to the public. Any request from a client to the control server has to be validated by the access control policy implemented on a smart contract. Examples of these requests are “create_audio_sender,” “create_audio_receiver," “create_video_sender,” and  “create_video_receiver.” To set up or create any type of data stream to send or receive data, the users’ profile or identity needs to have the privilege to do so, this is similar to a discretionary access control model.

The access control policy is implemented in Solidity smart contract using the OpenZeppelin’s role based access control library. In addition, the control server, which was written in Rust for optimized performance, uses the Web3 crates to interact with the blockchain network and the smart contract functions. The React Dashboard also uses the Web3.js library to retrieve the public states through the use of Solidity events.

3 main components were implemented:
- Policy.sol
- React DASHBOARD
- Rust Control_Server
