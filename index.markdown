## My Mission Statement
A driven and passionate engineer in the making at NYU, pursuing a major in _Computer Engineering_ with a minor in _Applied Physics_. My love for music coupled with my extensive background in software development has led me to my work at NYU High-Speed Research Network (HSRN), where I am currently working on a project that aims to develop a real-time audio processing system for live music performances. My goal is to create a system that can process and manipulate audio signals in real-time, allowing musicians to perform with greater flexibility and creativity. My next goal is to build expertise in the field of digital/analog system design and apply it to the field of music technology. More specifically, I hope to contribute to SoC systems with impacts on advanced real-time applications.

## NYU Global Leaders and Scholars in STEM

I am a member of the NYU Global Leaders and Scholars in STEM (GLASS) 2022 cohort program.

Utilizing the GLASS funding, I have managed to attend the 2nd largest C++ conference in the world (Core C++) and the KubeCon Cloud Native conference. Going to these conferences have exposed me to the current state of the art in the C++ programming languages as well as different cloud technology in the world. I also got to meet very technically comptentent engineers who inspired me to become an even better engineer.

I particularly love the GLASS community where I get to learn from the experience of other cohort's members and share memorable time on team building activites. I believe it is important to be aware of the interdisciplinary nature of engineering as no one field of STEM can exist on its own. GLASS gives me the chance to exercise this aspect through its many guest speaking events and its diversed community with members from all different majors.

I have grown both personally and professionally through GLASS. What I am most proud of from my GLASS experience  are the achievements that I have made in pursuing the NAE Grand challenges and the UN Sustainability goals.

## Fun Facts About Me

In my free time, I enjoy reading Medium articles and watching documentaries.
